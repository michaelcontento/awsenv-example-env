# This file is optional but will be included as the LAST step in 
# "awsenv init -". So if you want to specify some custom configuration values or
# even overwrite some stuff? This is the right place!

# Hint: You might want to export new environment values with export as below...
# export EC2_REGION=eu-west-1
